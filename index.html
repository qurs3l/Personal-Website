                Hello! My name is Seline Qureshi and I am a Computer science student at Texas A&M University. I’m originally from Richmond, Texas which is just south of downtown Houston and am currently living in College Station while I pursue my degree. My coding journey began in my freshman year of high school where the first language I learned was C++. Since then I have become proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and am currently pursuing becoming a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner.  My passion is in understanding new technologies, constantly pushing the boundaries of my skill set to make a meaningful impact through technology.
            </p>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Alongside my Computer Science studies, I am equally passionate about Mathematics which as led me to pursue a minor in the subject. From Calculus to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, I’ve dedicated myself to learn more areas of math that I am completely unfamiliar with. I'm particularly excited about my upcoming senior year, where I'll have the opportunity to explore Cryptography, a subject that has always intrigued me.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in a multitude of hobbies. Some of my favorites include drawing, reading, and listening to music. In the past, I have created art using many different mediums such as pencil, pens and gouache paint. Recently, I have ventured into digital art using Procreate on my iPad, even drawing some of the artwork for this website such as the stereo on the home page.  Music holds a special place in my heart, which is why I've incorporated it into this website, featuring some of my current favorite albums and songs on my AI page. I find immense joy in attending concerts and experiencing live music, due to the vibrant atmosphere from sharing musical moments with my friends and family. Additionally, I have an extensive CD collection containing tens of albums from artists across multiple genres.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                My journey through computer science, mathematics, and a variety of creative pursuits has shaped me into a well-rounded individual with a deep passion for technology and the arts. This website is a reflection of my experiences and interests, and I'm excited to share this adventure with you. Whether it's through coding, mathematical exploration, artistry, or the joy of music, I believe in the transformative power of these passions to make a positive impact on the world. Thank you for visiting and joining me on this exciting journey!
